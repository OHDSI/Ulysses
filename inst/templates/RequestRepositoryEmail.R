# Repository Request ------------------


# This file allows you to send an email to the ohdsi-studies github admin requesting for a new
# repository for an OHDSI study. This file uses the R package blastula.
# If you have a gmail smtp you must follow the instructions provided here:
# https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/6010255
# Gmail accounts must allow "Less Secure Apps" to use your Gmail account.
