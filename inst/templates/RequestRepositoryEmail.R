# Repository Request ------------------


# This file allows you to send an email to the ohdsi-studies github admin requesting for a new
# repository for an OHDSI study. This file uses the R package blastula.
# If you have a gmail smtp you must follow the instructions provided here:
# https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/6010255
# Gmail accounts must allow "Less Secure Apps" to use your Gmail account.

## A) Dependencies ------------------

# install.packages("blastula")
library(blastula)
library(tidyverse, quietly = TRUE)


## B) Variables -----------------

provider <- "gmail" # the smtp provider
repoName <- "{{{ RepoName }}}"
githubUserName <- "{{{ GithubUser }}}" # place your github user name
senderName <- "{{{ SenderName }}}" # place your name as the sender
senderEmail <- "{{{ SenderEmail }}}" # place your email as the sender
recipientName <- "{{{ RecipientName }}}" # name of recipient
recipientEmail <- "{{{ RecipientEmail }}}" # email of ohdsi-studies repo admin
dateTime <- add_readable_time() # Date and time that email is sent

## C) Setup SMTP -------------------

# You must provide the password for your email account

# setup the smtp credentials to send emails. Will notify you if key already exists.
create_smtp_creds_key(
