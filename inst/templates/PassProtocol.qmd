<!----
Overall research design and rationale for this choice, specifying the study design proposed (cohort, case-control, etc.) and any comparison groups. The primary and secondary endpoints and the main measure(s) of effect should be mentioned. The strength of the study design to answer the research question may be explained in this section.

## Setting

```{=html}
<!----
Setting and study population defined in terms of persons, place, study time period, and selection criteria, including the rationale for any exclusion criteria and their impact on the number of subjects available for analysis. Plans for baseline visits and follow-up visits should be described. Representativeness of the study population as regards the source population should be addressed. Where any sampling from a source population is undertaken, description of the source population and details of sampling methods should be provided. Where the study design is a systematic review or a meta-analysis, the criteria for the selection and eligibility of studies should be explained.
